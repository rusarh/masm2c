NOTE: Your code should build beforehand successfully with Masm (or UASM: http://www.terraspace.co.uk/uasm.html)
the masm2c tools do not even try to support you with the complexity of the reversing (if will not work if you're not able to build your reversed code with masm)
reversing a DOS program (or something) else is definitily more work then producing asm with IDA and run masm2c
Please source code or part for investigation.
